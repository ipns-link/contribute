# Contribute to IPNS-Link

**IPNS-Link** is and always will remain a free and open-source project for and by the community. So please help out anyway you can. At least [let us know](mailto:contact@ipns.live) of your support.

Some high-priority areas where serious help is urgently needed are :

### Port the codebase to Go, JS etc.

The current implementations, being prototypes, have been rather hurriedly hacked with Bash. That they still work, simply tells how better things would be once the codebase is ported to Go, JS etc. So, volunteer developers are needed. Implementing the Gateway in Go is rather urgent.

If are willing to work on it, create an issue [here](https://github.com/ipns-link/contribute/issues) to let us know of your project. For your implementation, you can follow the [specs](https://github.com/ipns-link/specs/blob/main/specs.md), which you are welcome to discuss, criticize, improve upon and contribute to, and reference the existing [version](https://github.com/ipns-link/ipns-link-gateway).

### Host public gateways

Volunteers need to host public [IPNS-Link-gateway](https://github.com/ipns-link/ipns-link-gateway)s, to offload https://ipns.live. The public gateways may be crowd-funded. Sponsors and well-wishers may donate using the corresponding link provided at the landing page of every gateway. Create a [PR](https://github.com/ipns-link/gateway-registry/pulls) to register your gateway with us.

### Host public relays

Perhaps most of IPNS-Link users would require NAT-traversal. So, volunteers need to contribute [public relays](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#how-to-enable-8). This may again be crowd-funded like the gateways. Create a [PR](https://github.com/ipns-link/gateway-registry/pulls) to register your relay with us.

### Report bugs

Report issues or bugs with the [existing implementations](https://github.com/ipns-link/specs/blob/main/specs.md#implementations). Just create an issue in the corresponding GitHub repository.

### Promote

Share and promote [IPNS-Link](https://github.com/ipns-link/specs). Write a blog or post in an online community. Create an issue [here](https://github.com/ipns-link/contribute/discussions) to share the link to that blog/post.

### Donate / Sponsor

[Chip in](/donate.md) with whatever you can. The funds raised will help us

1. Scale and operate the official public Gateway at [ipns.live](https://www.ipns.live). Currently, we can only afford a small server.
2. Retain the awesome domain name **ipns.live** for years to come. Otherwise it'd expire by 2023.
3. Host public relays for NAT traversal. Currently, there is only one public relay operated by Protocol Labs.
4. Host more public Gateways, distributed globally.
5. Incentivize excellent developers to improve the code base and add new features.
6. Compensate the maintainers so that they are encouraged to put more effort into this project.
